Purpose:
======
After receiving a new laptop at work and realizing I now needed to sift through the three years of files in my Downloads folder, I decided to create this program to automate the process of file movements between folders.

Usage:
======
1. Run FileMover.py
2. Input the following into the Tkinter window:
    * File extension that you wish to move.
    * Location path.
    * Destination path.
3. Click the "Set Path" button.
* Repeat steps 1-3 for all file extensions you wish to move.
* Click the "Run File Mover" button.
